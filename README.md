### Hi there 👋

- 👩‍💻 My name is Gina Häußge, but I also answer to my nickname foosel 😉
- 📢 This is how you pronounce my name: `[dʒiːna hɔʏsɡə]` - and since not everyone knows what to do with [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet), [here's a video of me saying it](https://twitter.com/foosel/status/1316753643077611520)
- 🐙 I'm the maintainer of [OctoPrint](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint) and you can [support my work on that here](https://support.octoprint.org) 
- 🔗 My home on the net is [foosel.net](https://foosel.net)
- 📫 You can reach me by mail at [gina@octoprint.org](mailto:gina@octoprint.org)
- 🦣 On Mastodon I'm [@foosel@chaos.social](https://chaos.social/@foosel). I don't really use Twitter anymore, but there I'm also [@foosel](https://twitter.com/foosel)

- 😄 My pronouns are she/her
- 🙊 I speak German and English, and also a bit of Spanish
- ⚡ Some fun facts: 
  * 🤓 That's a sharp s in my last name, not a b - see [ß](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9F)
  * 👩‍🍳 I'm a hobby baker with a focus on bread and pizza
  * 🎮 I own way more video games than I find the time to play, but that doesn't keep me from buying more
